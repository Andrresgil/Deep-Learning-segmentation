# Deep-Learning-segmentation
Color segmentation process for a first approach to machine vision, using Opencv libraries. 

Please execute as follows: 
  - Descomponer_Video.py
  - Proceso_Seg.py
  - Reconstruccion Video.py
    
the results of a possible segmentation according to the objectives can be the following:
